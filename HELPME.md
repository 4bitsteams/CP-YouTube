# I'm sending you this because your request takes more than one minute for me to process.

# Or, your question has already been addressed in one of my videos.

I made videos to answer questions, not for people to ask them again.

# I'm busy, I can't help you, and I never will. I have no obligation to process your request.

I'm simply too busy and I don't want to process your request.

## You are selfish and stealing from others

Your request takes at least 1 minute for me to process. During that 1 minute, I can create 1 / 1000 th of a video. A video on a general topic in CP can benefit up to 20000 people. After doing some simple math, you realize that you are stealing knowledge from 20000 * 1 / 1000 = 20 people, just for your simple request which could probably be solved if you tried a bit harder. If you are this lazy, that's probably why you aren't doing well in CP (or anything in life)!

## Asking me questions? Dumb!!!

I don't know why everyone thinks that it's a good idea to target me to ask all these questions. There are a lot of reds / good coders who don't have people asking them questions all the time. Why not ask them? They will definitely have the time, since pretty much nobody is asking them.

## Alternatives

In addition to asking some other red / good coder as I mentioned above, you can try to resolve the issue yourself, which is a good skill to learn. I have also created a Discord server (https://discord.gg/AneA5wg) so you can try to ask your question there and see if anyone wants to respond.
